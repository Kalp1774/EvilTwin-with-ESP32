üìå Overview:
EvilTwin is a compact and educational implementation of an Evil Twin Wi-Fi attack, executed using an ESP32 microcontroller and a matrix LED display. It creates a fake access point that mimics a real Wi-Fi network to capture connection attempts ‚Äî demonstrating how attackers can deceive users on public or insecure networks.

‚ú® Features:
Clone/imitate any Wi-Fi SSID (open network),
Broadcast deceptive AP via ESP32,
Display spoofed SSID, signal strength, or status on LED matrix,
Portable & real-time operation,
Designed for ethical hacking, security workshops, and demo labs.

üß∞ Tech Stack:
Hardware- ESP32 Dev Module, MAX7219 LED Matrix Display,
Software- Arduino IDE, WiFi.h, MD_MAX72XX or LedControl.h,
Language- C++ (Arduino).
